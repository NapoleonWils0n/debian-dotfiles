2016-10-19 00:23:39	somiaj	NapoleonWils0n: be careful, .xsession might not be sourced under the gnome session. You may need to edit the gnome session in /etc/X11/sessions or something liek that
2016-10-19 00:23:57	somiaj	NapoleonWils0n: .desktop files are farily easy to write, just look up the syntax.

I have made a "hotswap" server as a backup box, so if I get a hardware failure on a different machine I can stick the drives in the spare/hotswap and boot that. Now it does boot great when testing with my debian jessie hard drives - BUT the Network card doesn't work as it has a different one to the other systems. I just wondered how I can enable the network card to work with debian jessie if I need to

2016-10-19 23:30:36	jmcnaught	Resilience: it sounds like it is failing to resume then. If you're on Debian 8 with systemd you can run "journalctl" as root to see log entries for the current boot. There might be messages about this problem at the start of this log.
2016-10-19 23:30:59	aaro	NapoleonWils0n, you need to create an .Xresources file and set the urxvt config there, or if you just want to config the font the use the -fn and -fb options
