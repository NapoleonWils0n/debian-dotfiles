2016-08-26 22:31:33	laurus	Oh okay. I didn't know you could do that
2016-08-26 22:31:35	forcer	laurus: (list (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'b)) creates a list of three conses, all different. (let ((obj (cons 'a 'b))) (list obj obj obj)) creates a list of three conses, all identical. `make-list' does the latter, not the former.

2016-08-26 22:37:52	gnomon	NapoleonWils0n, when you say "the file" do you mean the org-mode file or the gpg private key file?
2016-08-26 22:38:04	benaiah	it's not like they're indistinguishable completely
2016-08-26 22:38:15	NapoleonWils0n	the text.org.gpg file
2016-08-26 22:38:52	gnomon	NapoleonWils0n, because it's incompressible, so git is unable to do its delta/diff thing?  Or for some other reason?
2016-08-26 22:39:00	laurus	benaiah, it just seems strange to me
2016-08-26 22:39:14	wasamasa	laurus: it's rarely a concern, so unless you're mutating data structures...
2016-08-26 22:39:23	NapoleonWils0n	when the org file is encrypted it has a gpg file entension, and would be stored as a binary blob in git
