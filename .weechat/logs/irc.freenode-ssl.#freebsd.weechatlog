2016-10-17 02:04:56	NapoleonWils0n	i have installed openbsd on a macbook before, and run pfsense on a macmini
2016-10-17 02:05:42	NapoleonWils0n	tried partition drive on mac sierra, then wouldnt boot and offered to reinstall lion
2016-10-17 02:06:22	NapoleonWils0n	lion was released in 2010
2016-10-17 02:07:04	Helio-	dunno, I have an older macbook, that barely runs lion

2016-10-17 02:07:40	NapoleonWils0n	trust me you dont want to try sierra
2016-10-17 02:07:51	Helio-	which I barely use now because it doesn't have a lot of power, even though I put an ssd in and doubled the ram, an older core duo can only do so much
2016-10-17 02:08:02	NapoleonWils0n	every time you close the lid you have to reboot by pressing power button for 10 seconds
2016-10-17 02:08:15	NapoleonWils0n	sierra wont resume from sleep

2016-10-17 02:10:02	Helio-	lovely
2016-10-17 02:11:27	NapoleonWils0n	and there is no way to reinstall without downloading a new installer on another mac and then creating a bootbale drive
2016-10-17 02:12:18	NapoleonWils0n	thx for the link will look into it
