2016-03-19 15:28:08	NapoleonWils0n	hi all
2016-03-19 15:28:26	haasn	fitz: it's an O, not a 0
2016-03-19 15:28:31	fitz	oh oops
2016-03-19 15:28:37	haasn	copy/paste to the rescue? :p
2016-03-19 15:28:46	haasn	fitz: also in fullscreen mode it might be easier to see
2016-03-19 15:29:16	NapoleonWils0n	im getting a black screen and no video with windows
2016-03-19 15:30:26	fitz	okay so it genere some noise where its needed to make it smoother?
2016-03-19 15:31:30	NapoleonWils0n	ive written some scripts to use mpv as an external player for kodi

2016-03-19 15:31:41	NapoleonWils0n	just cant seem to get mpv working on windows 10
2016-03-19 15:32:18	haasn	fitz: roughly speaking, yes
2016-03-19 15:33:13	fitz	what is debanding then?
2016-03-19 15:33:48	haasn	fitz: given an input source that already *has* banding (i.e. a source that was not dithered when converting to 8 bit), try to recover the original signal
2016-03-19 15:34:06	haasn	works by detecting+smoothing gradients and also adding some noise
