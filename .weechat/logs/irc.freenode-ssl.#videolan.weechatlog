2016-01-26 23:26:51	Draco_	NapoleonWils0n, I belive you can select the right screen in Preferences -> Video -> there is a dropdown menu
2016-01-26 23:27:55	NapoleonWils0n	i know there is something like that on mac osx but cant find it on linux will double check

2016-01-26 23:28:44	NapoleonWils0n	only have an option for output which is set to automatic
2016-01-26 23:29:38	Draco_	yeah, I can see now that option is under "DirectX", you obliviously don't have that one on linux ... can't help you there
2016-01-26 23:30:47	NapoleonWils0n	yes its more of a linux issue
2016-01-26 23:31:01	Draco_	you can try showing all settings, going in Video -> Exit Modules -> check whatever you are using as exit module
