2016-10-11 20:07:50	pgorley	do a ./configure --list-hwaccels to get a list of all of them
2016-10-11 20:07:50	shapsuk	ok give me a minute -- will also remove the existing source so that it grabs 3.1.1 or wateva is the current latest
2016-10-11 20:08:05	shapsuk	ok cool
2016-10-11 20:08:06	shapsuk	one sec
2016-10-11 20:08:06	NapoleonWils0n	anyone had this error and got any tips on how to resolve it
2016-10-11 20:08:10	pgorley	i use 3.1.3
2016-10-11 20:08:29	shapsuk	right

2016-10-11 20:11:52	shapsuk	oh wait its missing an 's' at the end right?
2016-10-11 20:11:52	pgorley	it's --enable-hwaccel=h264_videotoolbox, for example
2016-10-11 20:11:58	shapsuk	ahh ok
2016-10-11 20:12:05	shapsuk	thing is
2016-10-11 20:12:09	shapsuk	when I ran it earlier
2016-10-11 20:12:21	pgorley	like i said, do a configure --list-hwaccels to see which ones are available
2016-10-11 20:12:24	shapsuk	I noticed while it was running that all of those hwaccels were added
2016-10-11 20:12:33	shapsuk	all the videotoolbox ones
2016-10-11 20:12:45	shapsuk	I can try again anyway with the latest version though
2016-10-11 20:13:28	pgorley	in configure's output you have all those xxx_videotoolbox hwaccels under the enabled hwaccels section?
2016-10-11 20:13:55	shapsuk	yes

2016-10-11 20:14:45	pgorley	and you still get an undefined reference to av_videotoolbox_alloc_context?
2016-10-11 20:14:52	shapsuk	I did yes
2016-10-11 20:15:02	shapsuk	but I will try and rebuild with 3.x now
2016-10-11 20:15:04	shapsuk	and see
2016-10-11 20:15:53	shapsuk	I'll also add --enable-hwaccel=h264_videotoolbox --enable-hwaccel=h263_videotoolbox --enable-hwaccel=mpeg1_videotoolbox --enable-hwaccel=mpeg4_videotoolbox
2016-10-11 20:16:40	pgorley	ah, i see why i needed those switches, we have a --disable-everything at the top of our makefile for ffmpeg
2016-10-11 20:17:19	shapsuk	ah ok
2016-10-11 20:17:22	JEEB	that is a general thing some people tend to do. and then they get all kinds of issues when they're missing various stuff :)
2016-10-11 20:17:27	shapsuk	so for me, its not relevant lol
2016-10-11 20:18:10	pgorley	nope lol
2016-10-11 20:18:12	shapsuk	ok its building now
2016-10-11 20:18:23	shapsuk	I've just kept --enable-videotoolbox
2016-10-11 20:18:37	pgorley	should be autodetected though, looking at the configure script
2016-10-11 20:18:59	shapsuk	yeah and so now I get this during the build output:
2016-10-11 20:19:05	shapsuk	Enabled hwaccels: h263_videotoolbox	  h264_videotoolbox	    mpeg1_videotoolbox	      mpeg2_videotoolbox	mpeg4_videotoolbox
2016-10-11 20:19:09	shapsuk	which is right
2016-10-11 20:19:16	shapsuk	that's all the video toolbox ones
2016-10-11 20:19:27	shapsuk	but no different to before yet
2016-10-11 20:19:29	pgorley	that's good, how about when you build your application
2016-10-11 20:19:46	shapsuk	huh?
2016-10-11 20:20:09	pgorley	you're just compiling ffmpeg, or you want to use it with some of your code?
2016-10-11 20:20:20	shapsuk	I want to use it yes
2016-10-11 20:20:41	shapsuk	so basically I'm compiling into .h/.a
2016-10-11 20:20:48	shapsuk	then added it to my Xcode project
2016-10-11 20:20:54	pgorley	so you have some piece of code that calls av_videotoolbox_alloc_context?

2016-10-15 15:22:18	Phi	yo
2016-10-15 15:22:49	NapoleonWils0n	is there a way to work out the correct bitstream filter for a particular stream
2016-10-15 15:23:36	NapoleonWils0n	at the moment im manually testing streams and then going thru the possible combinations of bitstream filters

2016-10-15 15:25:27	NapoleonWils0n	cat always tell if an aac atream requires -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc or you can just -c:a copy

2016-10-15 15:26:46	NapoleonWils0n	thinking of either detecting the codecs used in the stream and then using the approiate bit stream filters or going thru the different options checking for errors
2016-10-15 15:33:15	c_14	NapoleonWils0n: if you use a recent ffmpeg (might only be in git) bitstream filters should be automatic
2016-10-15 15:34:47	NapoleonWils0n	c_14 really im running 3.1.4
2016-10-15 15:34:59	NapoleonWils0n	this is my script
2016-10-15 15:35:00	NapoleonWils0n	https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/kodi-playercorefactory/blob/master/bash-scripts/rip-record
2016-10-15 15:35:33	NapoleonWils0n	c_14 so ffmpeg should detect the correct bitstream filters for a stream
2016-10-15 15:36:05	NapoleonWils0n	even if us -c:a -c:v it will switch to using the correct bitsrteam filter
2016-10-15 15:37:58	BtbN	I don't think there is a release with the auto bsf yet.
2016-10-15 15:38:29	NapoleonWils0n	right ill keep a look out for the new release thanks guys
2016-10-15 15:38:52	BtbN	just use latest git master.
2016-10-15 15:38:57	NapoleonWils0n	is there any documentation about the auto bitstream filters
2016-10-15 15:38:58	BtbN	releases are mostly meaningless anyway
2016-10-15 15:39:07	BtbN	you don't do anything, and it works.
2016-10-15 15:39:22	NapoleonWils0n	i like the sound of that
2016-10-15 15:39:49	Phi	I tried what you said JEEB, but that documentation is out of date
2016-10-15 15:39:53	NapoleonWils0n	but if i specify -c:a -c:v it will override it with the correct bitstream filter
2016-10-15 15:40:00	Phi	can't find codecpar
2016-10-15 15:40:07	BtbN	a codec is not a bsf.
2016-10-15 15:40:39	Phi	I tried passing av_opt_set(codecCtx, "profile", "main", 0) but it ignores me and uses high
2016-10-15 15:41:27	furq	why are you using printf "%s\n" 'string' instead of echo "string"
2016-10-15 15:41:55	NapoleonWils0n	line endings, printf is also faster i believe
2016-10-15 15:42:06	furq	echo already adds a newline
2016-10-15 15:42:40	NapoleonWils0n	im not using line endings is some situations
2016-10-15 15:43:03	furq	echo -n
2016-10-15 15:43:35	NapoleonWils0n	im not really worried about printf vs echo
2016-10-15 15:43:50	furq	it sounds like i care more about echo than i actually do
2016-10-15 15:43:58	NapoleonWils0n	mor interested in getting the right combination of bitstream filters and codecs
2016-10-15 15:43:59	furq	i was wondering if echo didn't work for some reason
2016-10-15 15:44:33	NapoleonWils0n	furq bit like vim vs emacs and mac vs pc
2016-10-15 15:44:53	NapoleonWils0n	also the scripts have to work on windows, linux and mac
2016-10-15 15:44:58	furq	well no because emacs and mac users are just wrong
2016-10-15 15:45:16	NapoleonWils0n	yes furq with you on that one mate
2016-10-15 15:45:18	furq	portability seems like a more reasonable reason
2016-10-15 15:45:39	NapoleonWils0n	ill go with that excuse then :)
2016-10-15 15:46:03	NapoleonWils0n	scripts take a url and chop it up and create the correct ffmpeg command
2016-10-15 15:46:10	furq	although if you want it to be portable then you should use #! /usr/bin/env bash
2016-10-15 15:46:46	NapoleonWils0n	i have it working on all versions of windows, mac and linux which wasnt easy
2016-10-15 15:46:53	furq	or /bin/sh but it looks like you're actually using bash features
2016-10-15 15:47:40	NapoleonWils0n	yes im using bash pattern matching in a case statement to switch on various urls
2016-10-15 15:47:53	furq	well yeah there's no /bin/bash on the BSDs
2016-10-15 15:47:59	furq	and probably other unixes
2016-10-15 15:48:14	NapoleonWils0n	furq the scripts work on openbsd as well
2016-10-15 15:48:20	BtbN	furq, "echo -n" is bash. in a plain posix shell it would print a "-n something"

2016-10-25 22:33:07	NapoleonWils0n	are auto bitstream filters enabled in latest version on git
2016-10-25 22:33:13	llogan	refrijerator: ...and -framerate instead of -r for x11grab.
2016-10-25 22:33:33	llogan	and you don't need "-strict -2"
2016-10-25 22:33:35	NapoleonWils0n	is it possible to enable auto bit stream filters using any config options
2016-10-25 22:33:54	debkad	furq: i will work on those options, that really helpful, thanks again

2016-10-25 22:34:32	llogan	your ffmpeg is old
2016-10-25 22:35:09	refrijerator	it is in the stable branch in my distribution, gentoo
2016-10-25 22:35:31	llogan	2.8.6 that was old when old was young
2016-10-25 22:35:54	refrijerator	ok, I will keep that in mind, but seems to do what I wanted for now
2016-10-25 22:36:03	debkad	my ffmpeg ( compiled from git if i remember) is ffmpeg version N-81995-gd790e48
2016-10-25 22:36:34	debkad	is that ok?
2016-10-25 22:36:37	NapoleonWils0n	i see automatic bitstream filtering in the changelog on github
2016-10-25 22:37:16	NapoleonWils0n	im running 3.1.5 at the moment, is it a config option or am i just running an old version
2016-10-25 22:37:54	furq	the latest release usually doesn't have all the changes from git
2016-10-25 22:38:13	NapoleonWils0n	cheers furq
2016-10-25 22:38:29	NapoleonWils0n	so will have to wait for the changes to flow downstream
2016-10-25 22:38:35	furq	that change is probably part of the 3.2 branch
2016-10-25 22:38:47	furq	you could just use git head

2016-10-25 22:40:06	Substring	hihi ! i'm trying to capture video from stdin as well as the sound output with ffmpeg through ALSA. my audio device has no capture feature, i'd just like to record what i hear on the speakers. Is that possible ?
2016-10-25 22:40:21	NapoleonWils0n	Sustring yes it is possible
2016-10-25 22:40:35	NapoleonWils0n	i have done it myself i dig out a link to the code i used
2016-10-25 22:40:45	Substring	NapoleonWils0n, oh thanks :)

2016-10-25 22:45:27	NapoleonWils0n	Substring you need to create the alsa loopback device with code like this
2016-10-25 22:45:28	NapoleonWils0n	sudo modprobe snd-aloop pcm_substreams=1

2016-10-25 22:46:19	NapoleonWils0n	so you probably dont need that
2016-10-25 22:46:33	Substring	debkad, yes i am
2016-10-25 22:46:36	NapoleonWils0n	you can capture both you mic and any audio that is playing
2016-10-25 22:46:53	debkad	ok i think the loop idea from NapoleonWils0n worth a try
2016-10-25 22:46:58	NapoleonWils0n	what you need to do is set the application to use the alsa loopback device
2016-10-25 22:47:16	NapoleonWils0n	so in vlc for example you need to change the output audio device to alsa loopback
2016-10-25 22:47:31	NapoleonWils0n	note you wont be able to hear the audio playing but it will record
2016-10-25 22:47:41	Substring	well, i'd better make the loopback device the default output then

2016-10-25 22:47:58	Substring	that's just to test if I can do some screen casting
2016-10-25 22:48:19	NapoleonWils0n	i have used that technique on several screencasts for youtube
2016-10-25 22:48:36	debkad	sound very logic
2016-10-25 22:49:00	debkad	NapoleonWils0n: i guess it is a kind of a virtual device?
2016-10-25 22:49:10	Substring	debkad, i"m not using any software on which you can set on which device you want the sound output
2016-10-25 22:49:22	NapoleonWils0n	debkad yes exactly its a virtual audio device
2016-10-25 22:49:55	NapoleonWils0n	Substring you can set the loopback device to be default temporaily while you record
2016-10-25 22:49:56	debkad	Substring: yeah i understand that, the virtual loop device can capture the sound stream
2016-10-25 22:50:16	NapoleonWils0n	then you can then switch back when your finished recording

2016-10-25 22:51:37	NapoleonWils0n	i havent used h264_omx before
2016-10-25 22:52:02	Substring	well, then on a general matter : how do you define the encoder ?

2016-10-25 22:53:22	NapoleonWils0n	you dont need the filter complex in that code that was just a fix for my laptop
2016-10-25 22:53:41	NapoleonWils0n	steps are create the alsa loopback device
2016-10-25 22:54:00	NapoleonWils0n	use asoundrc to set it as your default audio device
2016-10-25 22:54:03	debkad	-codecs* my bad
2016-10-25 22:54:09	NapoleonWils0n	then record with ffmpeg

2016-10-25 22:54:56	NapoleonWils0n	obviously you need to work out the address of the mic

2016-10-26 15:56:51	Mad7Scientist	How can I watch a downloaded youtube video with separate audio and video? Run two player instances at the same time? I do know that I can encode them with ffmpeg and probably use the -copy codec
2016-10-26 15:58:04	DHE	depends on the player. mpv has an --audio-file option to select which file contains the audio track
2016-10-26 15:58:23	bencoh	mplayer has something like that as well ... I'd suspect vlc has one too
2016-10-26 15:58:24	Mad7Scientist	thanks
2016-10-26 15:58:34	DHE	correction, mpv
2016-10-26 15:58:40	DHE	sorry, old habit
2016-10-26 15:58:45	Mad7Scientist	with ffmpeg I tried .mp4 .avi .mov and finally .vob would contain both streams
2016-10-26 15:59:18	DHE	$ ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.mp3 -c copy combined.mkv
2016-10-26 15:59:54	bencoh	you might need to play with -map 0 as well
2016-10-26 16:00:37	Mad7Scientist	I did -vcodec copy -acodec copy
2016-10-26 16:01:48	NapoleonWils0n	DHE i see the dump_header bsfs options in git version, but no dump_headers in my build
2016-10-26 16:02:05	Mad7Scientist	the .vob file didn't work. mplayer said that the video dimensions were aut of range

2016-10-26 16:03:33	Mad7Scientist	yeah I do need -map

2016-10-26 16:06:34	DHE	bencoh: by default the files genuinely contain only audio and only video, my command works. if that's not the case, then yes some use of -map may become necessary
