2016-03-04 00:55:39	chris_se	quentusrex, my guess is thtat the debian HA maintainers plan to backport pacemaker once they think it's ready

2016-03-04 00:56:03	quentusrex	is there a separate irc channel for the debian ha maintainers?
2016-03-04 00:56:20	chris_se	quentusrex, for example, 1.1.14-2 is not in testing yet and if you look at the changelog from 1.1.14-1 (which is in testing), it's quite large: https://tracker.debian.org/media/packages/p/pacemaker/changelog-1.1.14-2
2016-03-04 00:56:36	NapoleonWils0n	anyone else having issues with vlc not displaying video
2016-03-04 00:56:48	chris_se	which means that they probably will at least want to backport 1.1.14-2 - but backports rules require that the package is in testing
