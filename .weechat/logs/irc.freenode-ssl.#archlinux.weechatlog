2016-02-01 16:53:08	Dumle29	Hey there. I'm running a Arch on an RPi1, and I'm running deluged, a bittorrent daemon with a web-ui. For some reason, at reboot, shutdown, systemctl shutdown etc, doesn't matter. but at boot, the config file for the web ui web.conf, is replaced with the default file, and the one with a better password in, is renamed web.conf~
2016-02-01 16:53:14	dagle	It depends on what you define as open, coreboot it self is open but it requires some closed source firmware on some platforms to work.
2016-02-01 16:53:15	MacGyver	Halfwit: Most *new* configurations.

2016-02-11 00:50:32	NapoleonWils0n	could it be something like ip forwarding if your using a bridge
2016-02-11 00:50:37	SpawnDemonic	i haven't im using inside vmware and have it to a bridge
2016-02-11 00:50:52	NapoleonWils0n	BeBel glad its working for you mate
2016-02-11 00:50:54	Namarrgon	if you did nothing to set it up, why do you expect it to work?
2016-02-11 00:51:12	SpawnDemonic	last time i tried to install arch i didn't have this issue
2016-02-11 00:51:21	Namarrgon	no, you had to set it up as well
2016-02-11 00:51:24	NapoleonWils0n	if i remember you cant add a bridge to a wifi interface

2016-02-12 01:21:41	boro	you can run the VM and windows at the smae time
2016-02-12 01:21:49	rabidfurby	with dual-boot you reboot, pick Arch, and it boots into Arch
2016-02-12 01:21:54	Shamison	Really?
2016-02-12 01:22:03	rabidfurby	with a VM you run Windows, and Arch is just an "app" in Windows
2016-02-12 01:22:05	NapoleonWils0n	but you will be fighting againist some virtualbox issues

2016-02-12 01:22:39	boro	its a good way to learn then when you are comortable you can install arch as your only OS ))

2016-02-12 01:23:20	NapoleonWils0n	i think you should get and external drive and install arch on that
2016-02-12 01:23:41	NapoleonWils0n	then you can boot up from the external drive and not get worried youll hose windows
2016-02-12 01:23:42	TheVelourFog	Halfwit, all of them
2016-02-12 01:23:43	Halfwit	NapoleonWils0n: So long as you have a phone, etc to peruse documentation as you go.

2016-02-12 01:23:58	rabidfurby	especially with Win10

2016-02-12 01:29:52	Magnetz74	Guys I backed up everything to a usb drive before reinstalling with 'cp -r' now I can't chown everything within the USB because it says operation not permitted, and everything it's copying over is now inside ' marks like 'Screenshot from ...'

2016-02-12 02:17:48	rabidfurby	without the initrd you have a chicken-and-egg problem where the module needed to decrypt your root FS lives on the encrypted root FS

2016-02-12 18:42:22	GodGinrai	grazzolini: yes, to other software.  But you would only download the other software in that update.

2016-02-21 00:25:08	annihilator	i would figure a flavor like ubuntu or sabayon be better for gaming. but oh well once i get arch installed i will get the best of both worlds. a flavor good for the games i want and for compiling programs from scratch

2016-03-01 15:12:57	The_ManU_212	hi, i run archlinux on an imac 2006early. the only way to get it booting is using super grub disk, to detect the grub.cfg and boot it. when using rEFInd, grub looks normal, vmlinuz and initrd.gz are found but, while booting, the machine just stops without error messages. even when booting with debug messages, there are none. the last boot messages are about the hard drives, but its somewhere between "welcome to archlinux" and before 
2016-03-01 15:12:59	The_ManU_212	the multi user target. "legacy" booting with grub super disk works. can someone help? the machine is intel based 32bit. it uses efi, since osx uses efi. if i boot the system in this "legacy" quirks way, all works as suspected, but i need it to boot through refind and not with some usb drive :/ thx for any recommendations!

2016-03-14 00:39:39	 *	afternuun stopped using dark themes upon learning not much energy is saved. It takes energy to make a pixel black while it is powered.
2016-03-14 00:39:50	alad	I don't recall the specifics on adwaita "dark", but arc theme is quite popular
2016-03-14 00:39:59	alad	afternuun: +1
2016-03-14 00:40:03	MacGyver	afternuun: Actually, you might be interested in my findings then.
2016-03-14 00:40:03	sheep	doesn't gtk3 use css?
2016-03-14 00:40:10	alad	it does
2016-03-14 00:40:11	MacGyver	afternuun: But I think I already mentioned this to you at least once.

2016-03-14 00:40:24	NapoleonWils0n	yes but gtk-3.0 css is empty in adwaita
2016-03-14 00:40:27	afternuun	MacGyver: yes, you did! About this time last year?
2016-03-14 00:40:29	MacGyver	afternuun: Turns out on light themes I can turn my backlight down by about 5 ticks further than on dark themes.
2016-03-14 00:40:38	MacGyver	afternuun: Possibly, yeah.
2016-03-14 00:40:42	@grawity	afternuun: depends on whether it's classic lcd, or led/oled
2016-03-14 00:40:43	NapoleonWils0n	says theme is part of gtk3 but cant find it
2016-03-14 00:40:45	MacGyver	alad: Well, that ^

2016-03-14 00:41:09	thrice	it's there by default
2016-03-14 00:41:10	MacGyver	So basically, my conclusion (and that of powertop) is that I actually save more energy on light themes.
2016-03-14 00:41:15	@grawity	NapoleonWils0n: adwaita is compiled into libgtk3 as a gresource

2016-03-30 16:05:54	MacGyver	mkoskar: Also, what's the difference between a removed tag locally, or a message that was removed externally?
2016-03-30 16:05:59	mkoskar	MacGyver: right, maybe we just need more notmuch clients, ... though you said that even syncing notmuch dbs is not easy? 
2016-03-30 16:06:02	MacGyver	mkoskar: How do you ensure you don't lose any mail?
2016-03-30 16:06:09	grazzolini	MacGyver: I think once you learn to think in terms of searches, all falls into place

2016-03-30 16:36:27	boblehest	I was afraid it wrote into stuff it shouldn't touch, but I guess it just ends up discarding the out-of-bounds writes.. or something like that. I'll try to google it.
2016-03-30 16:37:07	brainwave	MacGyver: My LCD is taking very less power (385 mW). I usually use a low brightness. The main draw is Wi-Fi at 4 Watts. Its really too much.

2016-04-02 00:49:46	Tazmain	NapoleonWils0n, debian is a bit more lively than ubuntu

2016-04-02 00:50:13	NapoleonWils0n	Tazmain when i was googling for debian fixes i just got hits from the arch wiki

2016-04-02 00:50:39	grazzolini	Gorka: even better under .profile
2016-04-02 00:50:48	szt	So there is a new nvidia driver in testing that I'd like to use. How do I use this testing package?
2016-04-02 00:50:55	Tazmain	NapoleonWils0n, same here :D best wiki though , one of the reasons I switched was due to the lack of knowledge mint help had 
2016-04-02 00:51:01	Namarrgon	szt: enable all testing repos and -Syu
2016-04-02 00:51:03	alad	Gorka: I use .pam_enviroment because it doesn't depend on a particular shell
2016-04-02 00:51:13	szt	Namarrgon: so testing is preferred over the normal? 
2016-04-02 00:51:16	alad	and the systemd user instance inherits whatever you put there 
2016-04-02 00:51:17	szt	or will it ask me?
2016-04-02 00:51:23	NapoleonWils0n	when you google for debian all you get is results listing packages
2016-04-02 00:51:27	phroa`	Boohbah, probably right about that config issue, it works with a different user. I don't know why, and I don't recall ever doing any KDE config edits, only configuration through settings

2016-05-20 01:09:08	CaptainCoward	hello. I have two gfx "cards", an onboard and a pci-e-x16 in my system. during boot the console goes to the onboard, which is fine I guess. I later load nouveau module for the external card. however, there is no output. dmesg shows an additional framebuffer fb1. how do I get a console on there?

2016-06-17 16:02:13	keenerd	Scimmia: Personally I think none of it should be automatic, since it is fragile.  But being able to specify "git-shallow+git://" instead of having the pkgbuild perform the checkout would be ideal.

2016-06-17 16:03:38	MacGyver	hollusion: Practically, unless you can boot into the windows itself first, no.
2016-06-17 16:04:15	MacGyver	hollusion: Because of how windows handles certain hardware drivers during install which don't play nice with the virtualized hardware, the drivers are simply missing if you try to boot an existing windows install without first massaging it.
2016-06-17 16:04:22	keenerd	Scimmia: Or perhaps a "shallow" flag so its easier to do it for other VCSes.

2016-06-17 16:05:17	MacGyver	hollusion: Also that doesn't directly boot the partition, but iirc you can directly boot a partition using qemu.

2016-06-17 20:58:24	cat5e	the problem is non-transparent background color

2016-07-27 21:36:53	keenerd	Because the spec is to wrap headings with # ?
2016-07-27 21:37:01	keenerd	The tail one is optional but it looks nicer
2016-07-27 21:37:03	Llewelyn	randomA: volts are a measure of electric force. amperes measure a quantity of electrons and a watt is the SI unit to measure /power/ which corresponds to the potential difference between one volt and the current one ampere.
2016-07-27 21:37:37	Llewelyn	randomA: Most PSUs are sold and rated in watts... usually expressed somewhere on a sticker.
2016-07-27 21:37:38	BrainDamage	not a quantity of electrons, a flux of charge

2016-07-27 21:39:08	Llewelyn	randomA: The voltate used by the system and especially your CPU, memory and GPU changes constantly as the resistance of the circuits is not static and it needs to rise and fall to meet those demands.

2016-08-26 19:52:40	grawity	krarkrrrc: you told zsh to interpret Ctrl+I as "~/"
2016-08-26 19:52:48	grawity	krarkrrrc: therefore Tab is interpreted as "~/"

2016-08-26 19:53:53	Earnestly	krarkrrrc: Because keyboards back then didn't always have a tab key

2016-08-26 19:54:03	grawity	it's probably not that they didn't have a tab key

2016-08-27 02:29:49	redfish	if doing this often, to avoid having to rebuild an extra time just to make the package, could istead just copy the binaries manually and 'makepkg -R'

2016-09-16 20:43:32	grazzolini	Earnestly: because startx works well with logind =D
2016-09-16 20:43:42	FIQ	sorry, grawity
2016-09-16 20:43:51	Earnestly	grazzolini: But, fundamentally misses out on the 'manager' bit
2016-09-16 20:43:51	grazzolini	blueyed: if you don't use a graphical display manager to login, yeah

It was easy with arch -- once I knew what I was looking at. On Debian it's a nightmare of subfolders and executable-only programs, and packages like network manager missing in the netinst and CD versions of the installers.

2016-10-26 14:45:18	NapoleonWils0n	hi all
2016-10-26 14:45:38	NapoleonWils0n	i was looking at the changelog on ffmpeg githubs page
2016-10-26 14:45:47	sigi	grazzolini: who is starting my awesome than? lightdm?
2016-10-26 14:45:50	NapoleonWils0n	i see there is automatic bitstream filtering enabled for ffmpeg version 3
2016-10-26 14:45:59	grazzolini	Harmonica: well, I know about dealing with large csv files a bit. but yes, opening large spreadsheets is not a nice thing
2016-10-26 14:46:06	grazzolini	sigi: oh my
2016-10-26 14:46:11	NapoleonWils0n	does anyone know if automatic bitstream filtering is enabled in ffmpeg on arch yet
2016-10-26 14:46:22	grazzolini	sigi: so, all this time you've been using a DM and was talking about .xinitrc?
2016-10-26 14:46:29	Namarrgon	NapoleonWils0n: look at the PKGBUILD
2016-10-26 14:46:36	grazzolini	sigi: DM's don't care about .xinitrc or .xprofile.
2016-10-26 14:46:42	NapoleonWils0n	gotcha mate will have a shufty
2016-10-26 14:46:50	Namarrgon	Harmonica: do you need to edit it too?
2016-10-26 14:46:55	Harmonica	grazzolini: i just do that to check if the structure of the file its ok or not, on windows excel does well but on libreoffice in linux just takes too long because its only using one core of my processor 
2016-10-26 14:47:03	Harmonica	Namarrgon: no, just check 
2016-10-26 14:47:11	Namarrgon	Harmonica: what does "check" mean?

2016-10-26 14:47:37	sigi	grazzolini: yes :|
2016-10-26 14:47:50	grazzolini	Harmonica: I use python csv for that
2016-10-26 14:47:57	Harmonica	Namarrgon: see if the data is placed in the right cells or not, if there is some information on some cell that doesnt match what im looking for and so on, i don't edit anything on the spreadsheet program 
2016-10-26 14:48:03	NapoleonWils0n	just checked the pkg no reference to automatic bitstream filtering
2016-10-26 14:48:10	sigi	grazzolini: i'm quite happy and don't touch that stuff as soon as lightdm works and awesome runs

2016-10-26 14:49:39	grazzolini	Harmonica: well, use python to do that. or something else
2016-10-26 14:49:41	c4757p	no sane developer would try to parallelize that...
2016-10-26 14:49:43	Harmonica	grazzolini: and for large files like 100mb libreoffice its slow because only uses one core to load the csv file, excel its jsut faster because uses all of them, i just a program that 
2016-10-26 14:49:47	NapoleonWils0n	Namarrgon do you think automatic bitstream filtering just hasnt been added to the pkg yet then
2016-10-26 14:50:16	NapoleonWils0n	the option should be in the git version of ffmpeg
