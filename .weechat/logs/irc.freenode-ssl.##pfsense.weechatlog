2016-06-28 23:02:51	NapoleonWils0n	just set up pfsense on a macmini and connected to bt inifinty isp
2016-06-28 23:03:11	NapoleonWils0n	have to set up wifi next, due i need to create a bridge
2016-06-28 23:03:36	PiBa-NL	Bama_411, looks like neighbour may not be a subnet but must be a 'ip' but i suppose youve already found that :)
2016-06-28 23:04:57	Criggie	gah insurance!
2016-06-28 23:05:56	PiBa-NL	NapoleonWils0n, no bridge should be needed.. though mDNS seems to like it... might want to use avahi if you configure seperate subnets for lan/wifi networks

2016-06-28 23:19:10	Criggie	A is different frequenties, so the other one might not work on A

2016-06-30 00:04:34	NapoleonWils0n	hi all second day with pf
2016-06-30 00:04:37	mdelise	I'm guessing its a firewall issue not allowing IGMP or UDP
2016-06-30 00:04:39	eth00	I have replaced the drives on a system and restored a backup taken right before the drive replacement. I am using a GEOM mirror. Now whenever the machine boots up it just hangs at configuring WAN interface. The configuration file does not use dhcp anywhere and I have left it for 20 minutes+ and nothing ever happens. The install I am using is 2.2.5 which I have tried upgrading to 2.3.1-release-p1
2016-06-30 00:04:39	eth00	and -p5 as well as not upgrading. The only difference is sometimes its a different interface it hangs on. The system was 2.3.1-release-p1 when I took the backup. Any ideas what is going on ?
2016-06-30 00:05:09	NapoleonWils0n	just looking at reserving an ip and then port forwarding bittorrent trafic
2016-06-30 00:05:39	mdelise	what's happening is, the TV channel will tune in for about 10seconds, then loses signal and stops,
2016-06-30 00:06:20	mdelise	change channel back, and it'll start again. so sounds like when it switches to the multicast its dropping
2016-06-30 00:07:00	Kingrat	what provider are you on?
2016-06-30 00:07:08	Kingrat	oh, uverse, nm
2016-06-30 00:07:28	mdelise	I've tried setting up the IGMP Proxy like i've found on some google searches
2016-06-30 00:08:10	mdelise	What can I watch, log wise to see what's causing it to stop
2016-06-30 00:08:45	NapoleonWils0n	to reserve an  ip adress you need to set it outside the dhcp range then you can port forward to that ip address, is that right
2016-06-30 00:09:02	mdelise	I've also checked this box for my rules Allow packets with IP options to pass. Otherwise they are blocked by default. This is usually only seen with multicast traffic.
2016-06-30 00:10:25	NapoleonWils0n	is the only way to forward traffic to a specfic ip on the lan to reserve it outside the dhcp range
2016-06-30 00:10:56	mdelise	no?. but what's the point if the lease renews and your dynamic IP changes
2016-06-30 00:11:31	NapoleonWils0n	right, coming from old router way of thinking
2016-06-30 00:11:58	NapoleonWils0n	how can i port forward if the lan ip doesnt remian the same
2016-06-30 00:12:06	mdelise	Dynamic is Dynamic...shouldn't matter. its never a guarantee it will stay. unless you're doing a Static lease
2016-06-30 00:12:26	mdelise	why does it not stay the same?
2016-06-30 00:12:35	mdelise	assign it a static ip or lease and be done with it
2016-06-30 00:12:46	Kingrat	NapoleonWils0n, generally they should stay the same, if you are worried do a static lease

2016-06-30 00:13:21	NapoleonWils0n	wondering the best way to forward bittorrent traffic to download iso
2016-06-30 00:13:59	Kingrat	NapoleonWils0n, at home i just enable upnp and let it figure it out, at work i disable upnp but it still works anyway (but probably not as good)
2016-06-30 00:14:08	mdelise	Kingrat: I have done an any for protocol, port, source and destination just to see if that would help.
2016-06-30 00:14:10	mdelise	no lukc
2016-06-30 00:14:22	NapoleonWils0n	i dont use upnp dont like it
2016-06-30 00:15:08	mdelise	NapoleonWils0n: Set your bittorrent client machine a static ip/or lease, then port forward the port you're using for that client to that static IP.
2016-06-30 00:15:12	Kingrat	mdelise, i dunno, my next step would be to break out tcpdump and see whats going on at a protocol level

2016-06-30 00:15:35	NapoleonWils0n	static lease sounds easiest
2016-06-30 00:15:57	mdelise	Kingrat: is that something you could help me with
2016-06-30 00:16:08	NapoleonWils0n	otherwise i would have to add a static ip outside the dhcp range
2016-06-30 00:16:14	NapoleonWils0n	gotcha thanks mate
2016-06-30 00:16:22	mdelise	Why does that sound so terrible ?
2016-06-30 00:17:18	NapoleonWils0n	i see there is a button for static mapping
2016-06-30 00:17:27	NapoleonWils0n	thought it would be more work thats all
2016-06-30 00:17:29	Kingrat	mdelise, not really, do you know how igmp works? it isnt terribly complicated if you look up the rfc and instructions on tcpdump and the expressions you can use to look for specific things
2016-06-30 00:17:30	mdelise	TBH, if your machine is getting a DHCP address and this is your home network i highly doubt you have enough devices connecting/disconnecting to overlap your pool so chances are it will always get that same IP renewed anyway.
2016-06-30 00:17:56	Kingrat	mdelise, unless you can find a specific guide for pfsense + uverse iptv
2016-06-30 00:18:26	mdelise	Kingrat: I've tried looking for something, not much out there.
2016-06-30 00:20:19	Kingrat	mdelise, ive also never used igmp proxy with pfsense so i wouldnt able to help with that aspect either, maybe there is a way to get more info on it like you can get from switches with igmp snooping
2016-06-30 00:20:54	mdelise	I'm not completely upto speed how IGMP works, other than its multicast 1 to many, or many to many
2016-06-30 00:21:38	Kingrat	yeah, its pretty simple, a client will join/leave multicast groups to receive traffic
2016-06-30 00:21:50	Kingrat	so you want to see that it is joining, and that traffic is coming back in
2016-06-30 00:22:51	mdelise	so wait explain the group part
2016-06-30 00:23:06	mdelise	My STB will send out a request?
2016-06-30 00:23:28	mdelise	and then establish a UDP session to the 224.0.0./4 i'm assuming out over the internet?

2016-07-06 21:17:52	Nocty	looks fine at a glance, I'd independently verify all of the sources though
2016-07-06 21:18:14	Nocty	EG make sure you're getting the package from a legitimate source
2016-07-06 21:19:58	NapoleonWils0n	yes goes without sating
2016-07-06 21:20:07	NapoleonWils0n	saying, thanks for having a look mate

2016-07-06 21:25:32	Nocty	you have a mac mini with 2 ethernet ports?
2016-07-06 21:25:38	Nocty	I didn't even know they made those
2016-07-06 21:25:54	NapoleonWils0n	no im using a thunderbolt to ethernet adaptor for the second nic
2016-07-06 21:26:25	NapoleonWils0n	works really well, but if you plug in another usb or thunderbolt to ethernet adaptor it stops working
2016-07-06 21:27:18	NapoleonWils0n	so got laptop plugged into macminis thunderbolt to ethernet adaptor and wan going into vdsl modem
2016-07-06 21:29:07	Nocty	you should be able to use any gig switch
2016-07-06 21:29:17	Nocty	provided you don't need VLAN capability
2016-07-06 21:29:42	NapoleonWils0n	i have vlan set up for the wan pppoe connection
2016-07-06 21:29:59	NapoleonWils0n	not on the lan

2016-07-08 23:19:13	NapoleonWils0n	hi all
2016-07-08 23:20:10	NapoleonWils0n	i have set google dns, but im still getting my isp dns on wifi
2016-07-08 23:20:21	NapoleonWils0n	guess its something to do with routes
2016-07-08 23:22:01	NapoleonWils0n	when i run dns lookup with the pfsense web ui it uses google dns, but its still using isp dns on wifi
2016-07-08 23:22:53	Harlock	it's nothing to do with routers
2016-07-08 23:23:01	Harlock	er routes
2016-07-08 23:23:24	NapoleonWils0n	im probably being dense and missing something
2016-07-08 23:23:47	Harlock	you have pfsense acting as the AP?
2016-07-08 23:23:56	NapoleonWils0n	i have allow dns servers to be overridden unchecked
2016-07-08 23:24:10	NapoleonWils0n	yes im using pf and usb wifi to create ap
2016-07-08 23:24:30	Harlock	those dns settings are for pfsense only
2016-07-08 23:24:51	Harlock	what you clients use is set in your dhcp scope
2016-07-08 23:25:02	NapoleonWils0n	right
2016-07-08 23:25:55	NapoleonWils0n	trying to find my way round the ui to find the dhcp settings
2016-07-08 23:26:39	NapoleonWils0n	i see dhcp / wifi you can specify dns servers
2016-07-08 23:26:42	NapoleonWils0n	will try that
2016-07-08 23:28:36	NapoleonWils0n	that worked cheers Harlock
2016-07-08 23:29:29	NapoleonWils0n	so you set the dns in the dhcp/ interface
2016-07-08 23:29:42	NapoleonWils0n	and the general settings are for pf, i get you mate
2016-07-08 23:30:25	nplus	I thought DHCP would use the system DNS if none was defined in DHCP?
2016-07-08 23:31:42	NapoleonWils0n	setting the dns in general doesnt seem to set the dns for dhcp interfaces
