2016-03-06 21:50:44	NapoleonWils0n	thought you could create a subtheme and add an additional css file 
2016-03-06 21:50:57	NapoleonWils0n	but it seems to override all the css from the theme
2016-03-06 21:51:02	phos1	should be able to just add the css file to the .info

2016-03-06 22:01:31	NapoleonWils0n	no i gave it a custom name
2016-03-06 22:02:06	NapoleonWils0n	to override bartik should i name the custom theme bartik as well
2016-03-06 22:03:24	Deliant	you need to declare bartik as the base theme in your subtheme's info.yml
2016-03-06 22:03:50	Lowell	NapoleonWils0n: did you copy the theme or are you sub-theming it?
2016-03-06 22:03:57	NapoleonWils0n	sub theme
