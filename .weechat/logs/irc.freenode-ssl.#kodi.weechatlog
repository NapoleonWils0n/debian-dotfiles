2016-10-12 16:05:18	NapoleonWils0n	is it possible to use the json api to open a particular link in an addon
2016-10-12 16:05:32	NapoleonWils0n	eg: open BBC 1 in iplayer
2016-10-12 16:06:19	NapoleonWils0n	id like to be able to automate opening different channels, a mate has used automator on the mac to simulate key presses
2016-10-12 16:06:40	NapoleonWils0n	just wondering if its possible to do the same thing with the kodi api

2016-10-12 16:12:17	Kib	i believe this depends in the add-on
2016-10-12 16:12:40	Kib	json-rpc has a self-describing property
2016-10-12 16:13:10	Kib	you want to do a json-rpc introspect, or a nice trick is to use the Chorus web browser which has json-rpc debugging tools included

2016-10-12 16:21:40	Kib	NapoleonWils0n: what is the use case for this exactly, if not piracy ?
2016-10-12 16:23:05	NapoleonWils0n	BBC has drm videos with iPlayer, that expire after set period

2016-10-12 16:23:36	NapoleonWils0n	this way you can record Eastenders without drm
2016-10-12 16:24:03	NapoleonWils0n	streams can be legit just depends on the user like everything else with kodi

2016-10-12 16:26:06	NapoleonWils0n	you can also multicast stream videos to all devices at once which you can do from within kodi
2016-10-12 16:26:30	NapoleonWils0n	or send ffmpeg command over ssh, get stats about the video
2016-10-12 16:26:43	NapoleonWils0n	use mpv, ffplay or vlc as external players
