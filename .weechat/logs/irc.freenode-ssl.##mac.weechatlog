2016-10-04 17:00:53	NapoleonWils0n	apart from the builtin terminal and iterm2 are there any terminals for the mac

2016-10-04 17:01:29	NapoleonWils0n	and you cant configure the builtin terminal to swap control and command
2016-10-04 17:01:54	NapoleonWils0n	seems to be less and less software for the mac
2016-10-04 17:03:32	ayaz	NapoleonWils0n: I've used iTerm2 for several years without it causing any issues.
2016-10-04 17:03:58	NapoleonWils0n	i wont use anything that tracks me with google analytics on principal
2016-10-04 17:04:51	NapoleonWils0n	looks like you either use the builtin terminal or iterm2 theres doesnt seem to be any other choice
2016-10-04 17:05:02	NapoleonWils0n	compared to linux it just a joke really
2016-10-04 17:05:47	NapoleonWils0n	they should have called the new release mac os fisher price and not sierra
2016-10-04 17:07:03	NapoleonWils0n	multiple desktop is unusable since it 5 seconds to do the animation and switch desktops

2016-10-04 18:49:00	NapoleonWils0n	any way to remap keys for just one app
2016-10-04 18:49:32	NapoleonWils0n	karibiner-elements for sierra doesnt work, is there a file you can edit somewhere
2016-10-04 18:49:37	bin_bash	no
2016-10-04 18:50:16	NapoleonWils0n	macs just get worse with every update
2016-10-04 18:51:00	SeepingN	Keyboard Maestro
2016-10-04 18:51:10	NapoleonWils0n	does it work on sierra
2016-10-04 18:51:15	SeepingN	I imagine
2016-10-04 18:51:36	SeepingN	not sure if it can remap the unmentioned keys you desire
2016-10-04 18:52:02	NapoleonWils0n	cost money i dont pay for software, only use open source
2016-10-04 18:52:22	SeepingN	I mean System Preferences can remap shortcuts. but if you want to remap things like option key, that's a little different
2016-10-04 18:52:41	SeepingN	then you shall have open source (which has nothing to do with money) results
2016-10-04 18:52:45	NapoleonWils0n	yes i looked at that but it remaps the keys system wide
2016-10-04 18:53:13	NapoleonWils0n	stupid to pay for something to remap keys
2016-10-04 18:53:17	Ussat	There is nothing that will remap a key for a specific program
2016-10-04 18:53:21	bin_bash	NapoleonWils0n: stop using os x then
2016-10-04 18:53:23	bin_bash	switch to something better
2016-10-04 18:53:41	NapoleonWils0n	i dont use osx i use linux, switched a few years ago
2016-10-04 18:54:03	bin_bash	ok
2016-10-04 18:54:06	bin_bash	same
2016-10-04 18:54:11	NapoleonWils0n	macs are like fisher price these days
2016-10-04 18:54:12	SeepingN	"Make a new command group which only applies to the application in question, then for each key you want to remap, make a new command with a hotkey trigger set to the real key and an "Insert Text" action set to what you want the key to be."
2016-10-04 18:54:17	bin_bash	thats why i dont really complain about new os x versions
2016-10-04 18:54:19	bin_bash	cuz i dont use them
2016-10-04 18:54:37	NapoleonWils0n	i only use the mac for testing things out

2016-10-04 18:54:54	NapoleonWils0n	switching desktop takes 5 seconds with animations
2016-10-04 18:54:54	Ussat	Linux is CRAP on the desktop
2016-10-04 18:55:10	NapoleonWils0n	Linux kicks osx up and down the street and back again
2016-10-04 18:55:17	Ussat	hardly
2016-10-04 18:55:49	bin_bash	i have fewer problems with linux than i ddi with os x but everyone has different needs
2016-10-04 18:55:54	NapoleonWils0n	there are no apps for macs these days, apart from in the crap store
2016-10-04 18:56:07	Ussat	There are plenty of apps avaliable
2016-10-04 18:56:13	Ussat	outside the app store
2016-10-04 18:56:39	NapoleonWils0n	if you want a terminal you have 2 choices bultin terminal or iterm2
2016-10-04 18:56:48	NapoleonWils0n	and they both suck compared to urxvt

2016-10-04 18:58:47	Ussat	again, Linux on a desktop is crap
2016-10-04 18:58:56	bin_bash	that's your opinion
2016-10-04 18:59:04	Ussat	only Linux I bother with is a command line
2016-10-04 18:59:06	bin_bash	just like my opinion is that it works better than os x did
2016-10-04 18:59:18	NapoleonWils0n	mac = comsumer toy, linux = real computer

2016-10-04 19:02:08	ritsuka	nope, still a kernel even if you are a power user
2016-10-04 19:02:47	Ussat	Oh sure, I am not a power user, I just manage the Unix infrastructure of one of the biggest Universities in the US
2016-10-04 19:02:58	Ussat	I have no idea what I am talking about

2016-10-10 14:50:18	HotStar	if i buy mac mini, then i can see mini screen with mac book pro?
2016-10-10 14:51:09	NapoleonWils0n	you mean with screensharing
2016-10-10 14:51:33	NapoleonWils0n	but you will to plug the mini into a display first to do the config
2016-10-10 14:51:44	HotStar	i means that i can use mac book pro as screen into mac mini
2016-10-10 14:51:54	NapoleonWils0n	no 
2016-10-10 14:52:01	NapoleonWils0n	dont think so
2016-10-10 14:52:13	NapoleonWils0n	you would have to use screensharing
2016-10-10 14:52:15	ahihi	the MBP doesn't have a video input, no
2016-10-10 14:52:16	HotStar	impossible?
2016-10-10 14:52:33	HotStar	then i must buy monitor for mac mini?
2016-10-10 14:52:34	Branes	HotStar: Not possible.
2016-10-10 14:52:45	ahihi	NapoleonWils0n: you've checked with kextstat, just to be sure?
2016-10-10 14:53:02	Branes	Yes, the mini will need its own screen, or you run it headless and use screen-sharing (which is slow)
2016-10-10 14:53:03	NapoleonWils0n	ahihi yes first thing i checked
2016-10-10 14:53:11	NapoleonWils0n	also reset the pram
2016-10-10 14:53:27	HotStar	i don’t know what is screen sharing
2016-10-10 14:53:30	NapoleonWils0n	vnc
2016-10-10 14:53:44	HotStar	oh
2016-10-10 14:53:51	HotStar	vnc is screen sharing?
2016-10-10 14:53:59	NapoleonWils0n	thats what apple call it
2016-10-10 14:54:33	HotStar	when i turn on mac mini at first time, then how can i do screen sharing.
2016-10-10 14:54:49	Branes	It is a form of logging in to a remote computer and it pushes its screen over to your first computer. Pushing all those pixels over a network connection is slow.
2016-10-10 14:54:50	NapoleonWils0n	plug it into a display, then you can enable screensharing
2016-10-10 14:55:16	NapoleonWils0n	if you are looking for performance screen sharing isnt for you
2016-10-10 14:55:17	ahihi	screen sharing performance is fine for most tasks over a good LAN
2016-10-10 14:55:21	HotStar	plug mini into mac book pro?
2016-10-10 14:55:27	Branes	HotStar: No.
2016-10-10 14:55:33	Branes	Needs its own display first.
2016-10-10 14:55:49	HotStar	it need display at first.
2016-10-10 14:55:54	NapoleonWils0n	you will need a display to set up screensharing
2016-10-10 14:56:01	Branes	And the Mac mini does not run very well without a display connected anyway.
2016-10-10 14:56:05	HotStar	:|
2016-10-10 14:56:16	NapoleonWils0n	so you will have to buy one anyway in which case there is no point using vnc
2016-10-10 14:56:20	NapoleonWils0n	just use the monitor
2016-10-10 14:56:23	Branes	Yup.
2016-10-10 14:56:51	NapoleonWils0n	i turned my macmini into a pfsense router
2016-10-10 14:56:52	HotStar	i just want to use it as server.
2016-10-10 14:56:59	HotStar	so i don’t need monitor
2016-10-10 14:57:06	NapoleonWils0n	new flat minis are much slower than the old minis
2016-10-10 14:57:27	Branes	HotStar: You still need the mini to have its own display so you can set it up as a server.

2016-10-10 14:57:44	NapoleonWils0n	HotStar you could plug the mini into the tv with hdmi or vga
2016-10-10 14:57:57	NapoleonWils0n	set it up, then unplug from the tv
2016-10-10 14:58:00	HotStar	i have no TV
2016-10-10 14:58:18	NapoleonWils0n	well then youll have to buy a display
2016-10-10 14:58:26	NapoleonWils0n	no way round it
2016-10-10 14:59:02	HotStar	yeah
2016-10-10 14:59:28	HotStar	but raspberry pi don’t need screen.
2016-10-10 14:59:33	HotStar	at first time
2016-10-10 14:59:40	Branes	Borrow one, doesn't have to be big, but it does need DVI or HDMI input.
2016-10-10 14:59:41	ahihi	a mac is not a raspberry pi
2016-10-10 15:00:02	HotStar	No one borrow it to me
2016-10-10 15:00:39	ahihi	you can probably find an old TFT for like 10 bucks at an electronics recycling center or something
2016-10-10 15:00:45	Branes	Macs are designed to be graphically-operated end-user machines, not something you can telnet/SSH into (at least, not until you set it up for that)
2016-10-10 15:01:22	HotStar	graphically operated end usr machine
2016-10-10 15:01:30	HotStar	but i use terminal only
2016-10-10 15:01:33	HotStar	because i m hacker
2016-10-10 15:01:35	HotStar	8)
2016-10-10 15:01:43	Ussat	a hacker......um, sure
2016-10-10 15:01:53	ahihi	so why do you want to run a mac server? xcode building?
2016-10-10 15:02:27	HotStar	when i go to outside, then i must connect to my computer.
2016-10-10 15:04:20	HotStar	ahihi:
2016-10-10 15:04:38	NapoleonWils0n	it you want a server dont use a mac, use linux or bsd
2016-10-10 15:04:56	NapoleonWils0n	macs suck for open source tools
2016-10-10 15:05:03	HotStar	thanks
2016-10-10 15:05:07	NapoleonWils0n	use a proper operating system for a server
2016-10-10 15:05:14	NapoleonWils0n	not osx fisher price
2016-10-10 15:05:17	HotStar	then i use raspberrypi as server?
2016-10-10 15:05:43	Branes	Depends on what you want to have served.
2016-10-10 15:05:49	ahihi	if your needs are served by a raspberry pi, I don't understand why you're considering a mac
2016-10-10 15:06:56	NapoleonWils0n	never ever use a mac as a server, they are useless for that
2016-10-10 15:06:57	HotStar	because i m afraid that fire will occur when i use server
2016-10-10 15:07:06	HotStar	ok
2016-10-10 15:07:27	HotStar	then liunux computer is better than mac book pro?
2016-10-10 15:07:40	NapoleonWils0n	no documentation at all for apple stuff and no community compared to linux
2016-10-10 15:08:02	Ussat	Branes, can you silence the little kids and have them go back to the kids table ?
2016-10-10 15:08:26	mwilson	Ussat: Yeah, the linuxers seem a little strident this morning.
2016-10-10 15:08:34	HotStar	i will stay without talking here thanks
2016-10-10 15:09:03	NapoleonWils0n	have you every tried building ffmpeg on a mac, with loads of undocumented flags
2016-10-10 15:09:18	HotStar	i don’t know ffmpeg
2016-10-10 15:09:21	NapoleonWils0n	or building an apache web server
2016-10-10 15:09:25	Branes	Tsk tsk, how else are the poor dweaks going to see the error of their ways and leave the Dark Side, hmm? :)
2016-10-10 15:09:42	mwilson	Uh, if the flags are undocumented, that'd be a problem with your vaunted open source, not with the Mac.
2016-10-10 15:09:57	NapoleonWils0n	thats why all the super computers run linux, not mac osx
2016-10-10 15:10:01	ahihi	I don't recall having any trouble with ffmpeg or apache
2016-10-10 15:10:25	NapoleonWils0n	no you need special flags to build ffmpeg on mac and apple breaks the updates with every release
2016-10-10 15:10:40	HotStar	i need laptop, but i don’t know which linux computer or used mac book pro are good?
2016-10-10 15:10:43	NapoleonWils0n	and there is no documentation, and they remove questions from the forum
2016-10-10 15:11:18	Branes	HotStar: Sounds like you'd be better off with linux all round. Macs aren't for hackers & tinkers.
2016-10-10 15:11:21	NapoleonWils0n	debian jessie or arch linux if you want to build it yourslef
2016-10-10 15:11:44	ahihi	or just look at what homebrew does with it ;)
2016-10-10 15:11:50	mwilson	I'm not surprised, given the nick, but really, can't you take the religiosity to #linux?
2016-10-10 15:11:53	NapoleonWils0n	exactly macs are locked down consumer devices
2016-10-10 15:12:23	Branes	NapoleonWils0n: The reason why people buy Macs is to get *away* from all that nonsense! Sure, its a certified UNIX, but it's not meant to be treated like one.
2016-10-10 15:12:31	thelostpatrol	macs aren't locked down
2016-10-10 15:12:36	thelostpatrol	what are you talking about
2016-10-10 15:12:40	ahihi	there is more than one reason why people buy macs
2016-10-10 15:13:50	Ussat	Branes, ping me when there are some people here talking about what they know...I have actualy wok to do, on my mac
2016-10-10 15:14:43	ahihi	while many macs do get hot, I would not recommend using them for wok
2016-10-10 15:15:33	mwilson	Do you use sesame or peanut oil when you wok with your Mac?

2016-10-10 15:16:44	HotStar	how about using mac + linux on vmware instead of linux laptop?
2016-10-10 15:16:58	Branes	HotStar: Provided the machine is a Mac, fine.
2016-10-10 15:17:32	thelostpatrol	i run a lot of linux vms because of testing/tinkering at work
2016-10-10 15:17:49	thelostpatrol	it's good that way, because you can contain it all and not mess things up

2016-10-10 15:28:04	ahihi	nobody knows
2016-10-10 15:31:33	Matreya	the mac pro is entirely different from the macbook pro
2016-10-10 15:31:54	Matreya	the new macbook pro is due to be released this month, near the end of the month
2016-10-10 15:32:08	thelostpatrol	nothing is due at any point
2016-10-10 15:32:23	thelostpatrol	there are not set dates with apple releases
2016-10-10 15:38:01	Matreya	then let me preface my statement with 'it's widely speculated'
2016-10-10 15:38:46	Matreya	apple better do something with their macs, they're falling behind the rest of the PC world
2016-10-10 15:39:21	Ussat	Depends how you define falloing behind, latest and greatest hardware means very little

2016-10-10 15:48:27	ahihi	given that e.g. GPU and storage technologies are still evolving at a decent pace, that's not universally true
2016-10-10 15:51:00	Matreya	apple neutered the mac mini, haven't updated the mac pro in 3 years (apart from soldering the CPU to prevent upgrading), the iMac retina has a series of crappy GPUs
2016-10-10 15:51:20	NapoleonWils0n	macs = locked down and dumbed down
2016-10-10 15:51:36	NapoleonWils0n	locked down = sips + dumbed down = final cut x
2016-10-10 15:51:41	NapoleonWils0n	case in point
2016-10-10 15:52:14	ahihi	your equations don't make much sense

2016-10-15 18:27:30	NapoleonWils0n	any fix for the sleep bug on sierra
2016-10-15 18:29:54	NapoleonWils0n	reseting pram dosnt work, bit of joke really
2016-10-15 18:30:22	NapoleonWils0n	apple should try and make things that actually work rather than adding pointless icandy and animations
2016-10-15 18:32:15	@Ziginox	sierra is a feature release, what did you expect? :)
2016-10-15 18:32:55	NapoleonWils0n	something that actually works would be a start
2016-10-15 18:33:59	NapoleonWils0n	using itunes to download an app and then install on ios is a nightmare
2016-10-15 18:34:25	NapoleonWils0n	they actually hide the apps links from the main menu, have to enter pasword multiple times to download something
2016-10-15 18:35:09	NapoleonWils0n	click thru the sidebar several levels, download click install sync 
2016-10-15 18:35:55	NapoleonWils0n	the old method was better click to download plug in ios device and sync automatically
